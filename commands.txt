# Allow external traffic

By default, the pod is only accessible by its internal IP within the cluster. In order to make the hello-dotnet container accessible from outside the kubernetes virtual network, you have to expose the pod as a kubernetes service.

$ kubectl expose deployment <deployment> --type="LoadBalancer" --port=<port>

To find the publicly-accessible IP address of the service, simply request kubectl to list all the cluster services:

$ kubectl get services

Manually scaling the number of replicas

$ kubectl scale deployment <deployment> --replicas=4

Verify number of pods

$ kubectl get pods
